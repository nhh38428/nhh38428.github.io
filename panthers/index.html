                <p>
                    Being born and raised in North Carolina, I decided to create a web page representing my beloved NFL football team, the Carolina Panthers. Based out of Charlotte, NC the Panthers have accounted for seven playoff appearances and a grand total of zero Super Bowls in their 24 year history. Lead by Auburn alum (sadly), Quarterback Cam Newton and the “Cats” have had much recent success. 
                    <hr>
                    In 2015 the Panthers rolled through the NFC division, marking a 15-1 regular season record, earning playoff birth as the number one seed. Ultimately the team would earn themselves a matchup in Super Bowl 50 against hall of famer Peyton Manning, and the Denver Broncos. With a stout defense and “The sheriff” leading the way, the Broncos would cruise to a 24-10 victory.
                    <hr> 
                    Some of my fondest memories in Bank of America stadium are watching the “Thers” take on legends like Drew Brees of the New Orleans Saints, and the notorious Terell Owens in his prime. The Panthers currently sit atop the NFC South at 7-3, and with the leadership of head coach Ron Rivera, a veteran defense lead by Carolina hero Julius Peppers, and a young and explosive offense, the future looks bright for the blue and black.
